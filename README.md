This plugin for Minecraft makes fire arrows really fire and adds some other features

So what it adds:
* If a fire arrow hits burnable block (like leaves, wood, planks etc.) it can put it on fire with 50% chace.
* If a fire arrow hits creeper he will instantly explode :)
* If an arrow hits primed TNT it will instantly explode.
* You can put out fire on arrows with a splash of any water potion.

Also if a creeper just taking fire damage he can suddenly explode with 10% chance per each damage take.
